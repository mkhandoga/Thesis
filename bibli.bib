It is convenient to apply the term `meson' to any particle with a mass intermediate between that of a proton and an electron. In continuing our experiments we have found evidence of mesons which, at the end of their range, produce secondary mesons. We have also observed transmutations in which slow mesons are ejected from disintegrating nuclei. Several features of these processes remain to be elucidated, but we present the following account of the experiments because the results appear to bear closely on the important problem of developing a satisfactory meson theory of nuclear forces.},

These photographs have been selected from five thousand photographs taken in an effective time of operation of 1,500 hours. On the basis of the analysis given below we believe that one of the fonked tracks, shown in Fig. 1 (tracks a and b), represents the spontaneous transformation in the gas of the chamber of a new type of uncharged elementary particle into lighter charged particles, and that the other, shown in Fig. 2 (tracks a and b), represents similarly the transformation of a new type of charged particle into two light particles, one of which is charged and the other uncharged.},

They are just the ambiguities characteristic of any trivial — and thus effective — theory. If QED remained an isolated theory up to an energy close to its triviality scale, these ambiguities would surely hint at new physics. This not being so, the renormalon ambiguities in QED lead to no new physics, not even to non-perturbative contributions within QED itself."

We give an introduction to the construction of the basic Lagrangian, some details on the calculation of amplitudes at the one-loop level, higher-order calculations for electroweak precison observables are obtained, with emphasis on the W, Z masses and the Z resonance observables. The predictions of the Standard Model are compared with the experimental data, with implications for the Higgs bosons. A brief look to the supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model in terms of the MSSM and its performance in view of the precision data concludes the lecture.}

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
	of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
	moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
	efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
	of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
	data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
	objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
	hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
	tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
	discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
	algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
	to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
	Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
	favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
	a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = "Experimental measurements of Drell-Yan (DY) vector-boson production are available from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and from lower-energy collider and fixed-target experiments. In the region of low vector-boson transverse momenta qT, which is important for the extraction of the W-boson mass at the LHC, QCD contributions from non-perturbative Sudakov form factors and intrinsic transverse momentum distributions become relevant. We study the potential for determining such contributions from fits to LHC and lower-energy experimental data, using the framework of low-qT factorization for DY differential cross sections in terms of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution functions. We investigate correlations between different sources of TMD non-perturbative effects, and correlations with collinear parton distributions. We stress the relevance of accurate DY measurements at low masses and with fine binning in transverse momentum for improved determinations of long-distance contributions to Sudakov evolution processes and TMDs."

The weak point of the Bayes approach, namely the need of the knowledge of the initial distribution, can be overcome by an iterative procedure. Since the method proposed here does not make use of continuous variables, but simply of cells in the spaces of the true and of the measured quantities, it can be applied in multidimensional problems."

Ultimately, therefore, the measurement of these cross sections will provide a powerful cross check on our knowledge of parton distributions and their evolution.},

It has long been recognized as a technique of almost unique promise for shape and motion analysis in images containing noisy, missing, and extraneous data but its adoption has been slow due to its computational and storage complexity and the lack of a detailed understanding of its properties. However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area."

We include new kinematic top quark and W boson mass measurements from the LHC, a {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sin {\backslash}!^2{\backslash}theta ^{\{}{\backslash}ell {\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}sin2$\theta$effℓresult from the Tevatron, and a new evaluation of the hadronic contribution to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha (M{\_}Z^2){\$}{\$}$\alpha$(MZ2). We present tests of the internal consistency of the electroweak Standard Model and updated numerical predictions of key observables. The electroweak data combined with measurements of the Higgs boson coupling strengths and flavour physics observables are used to constrain parameters of two-Higgs-doublet models.},
